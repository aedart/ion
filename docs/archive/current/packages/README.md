# Packages

In here, you will find documentation for the available packages. A few things that might be good to know:

[[TOC]]

## Environment

Badges are used to indicate the environment that a package is intended for, e.g. <Badge type="success" text="Node" vertical="middle" /><Badge type="success" text="Browser" vertical="middle" />.

_You are of course welcome to use a package in a different environment than its original intent, if it is possible._

## Available Since

The "_available since x.y.z_" badge might also be displayed, if a package _or feature_ was released during a minor version. E.g. <Badge type="tip" text="Available since v1.5" vertical="middle" />.

## Not Released

Sometimes, documentation might be available for a package that has **not yet been released**. 
Usually it is tagged with a <Badge type="warning" text="Not Released" vertical="middle" /> badge, _unless the package documentation is located in ["next" release"](../../next/README.md)._

## Not Published

In rare situations, a package might only exist in the mono-repository and not published to npm's registry.
Such a package is either experimental or internal, which means that it might not ever be published.
Usually, it will be tagged with <Badge type="danger" text="Internal (not published)" vertical="middle" /><Badge type="danger" text="Experimental" vertical="middle" />, or similar badges, _if documentation is made available about the package!_
