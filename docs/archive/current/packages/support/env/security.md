# Security

You should be very mindful what environment variables you chose to expose in your runtime environment.
If you are parsing `.env` files and injecting them into your runtime, please consider using a dedicated
file for your front-end application only (_e.g. name it `.front-end`, `.browser` or something similar._).
It is important that you are able to clearly distinguish between environment variables for your backend, and
for your front-end. You do not want to end up in a situation where you accidentally expose sensitive variables
to the front-end!

Furthermore, the `Env` component is **_NOT_** able to prevent unintended access to the environment variables, that you
may choose to expose to your front-end application. You should always assume that
**_all_** environment variables are **_PUBLICLY AVAILABLE_**, in the browser!
