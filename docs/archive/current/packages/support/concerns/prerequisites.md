# Prerequisites

At the time of this writing, [decorators](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decorators) are still in a proposal phase.
To use concerns, you must either use [@babel/plugin-proposal-decorators](https://babeljs.io/docs/babel-plugin-proposal-decorators), or use [TypeScript 5 decorators](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-5-0.html#decorators).
