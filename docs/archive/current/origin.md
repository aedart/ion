# Origin

## The Origin of Ion

Like so many other developers, for years I had been copying and pasting JavaScript from one project into another.
I always knew that it was a poor way to resolve my needs. But, I was too discouraged to adapt and publish that JavaScript as packages.
This was mainly due to the high workload, whilst also maintaining [Athenaeum](https://aedart.github.io/athenaeum/).
Even so, with the advances of [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and many other tools and frameworks,
I decided that it was about time to give this another shoot.
